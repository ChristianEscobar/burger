## What Is It?

Burger Chomp is a burger logger application created using MySQL, Node, Express and Handlebars.

## How Does It Work?

* Burger Chomp is a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Chomp It!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The application stores every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.

## How Do I Use It?
